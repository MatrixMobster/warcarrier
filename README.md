Warcarrier is a dashboard for scanning and trolling 802.11 WiFi, 802.15.1 Bluetooth, and GPS. This application was designed to show a large amount of live data, as a large carrier ship may have in the main deck/helm. The name "Warcarrier" was inspired by the famous "Blue Ghost" aircraft carrier. Below are a few functions that can be done with Warcarrier,
<ul>
	<li>CatchMe-NG for trolling for MAC addresses, ESSIDs, etc</li>
	<li>Create Shareable Waypoints</li>
	<li>Take instantaneous snapshots of the surrounding area (GPS/BT/WiFi/Timestamp/APs/etc)</li>
	<li>Log results in text format</li>
	<li>Log results in HTML format</li>
	<li>Include interactive maps from their scans using the Google Maps API</li>
	<li>Read detailed information on any satellite that you can receive from (Using PNRID and NASA data)</li>
</ul>

# Usage
Start Warcarrier: ./warcarrier -d (wlan device) -f (airodump-NG output file name)<br />
In Weakerthan Linux, you can simply click on the Warcarrier icon in the dock.

Your Terminal must have specific setting enabled. I am almost always using Gnome Terminal and the settings in WEAKERTHAN Linux are shown in the screenshot below. Without these setting the Curses::UI Perl module creates a lot of garbage on the screen that is unreadable.

** NOTE in KALI Linux you may have to edit your /etc/default/gpsd to have START_DAEMON and USBAUTO to "false". Also, you may need to reboot as restarting/reloading the daemon doesn't seem to complete the process - All credit for the troubleshooting of this and info for KALI goes to Grant Stone.
